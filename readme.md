# Shopping Cart Return
## Ludum Dare 33 - Theme :You Are The Monster

My entry to the Ludum Dare 33 48 hour competition. Identify the person who
is not going to return their shopping cart before they get in their car.

You get points for identifying a Monster who is going to leave their cart. The available parking spaces drop everytime someone gets away with leaving their cart.
Once the number of available parking drops below 50% the game is over.
